## Overview 
The UFO sightings project is intended to display a dynamic webpage with all sightings data to track date, city, state, country, shape, duration and any additonal comments for the UFO sightings. In order to make data more accessible, these records are created in table format with a filter column for each field to narrow down searches for specific sightings. 

## Results:
The data is displayed on one page and has no specific order. The user needs to scroll down to view remaining records. The data includes dates for 1/1/2010 and 1/13/2010 and is not current.

Multiple filters are shown on the right side of the page and can be used to locate specific records based on the selected criteria. Multiple filters can be selected at the same time to view results.

## Summary: 

### Drawback:
A drawback to the filters is that values are case sensitive and the user needs to know the exact spelling of the value in the data in order to perform a search.

### Additonal Recommendations: 
The first recommendation is to add a sort to the columns to make it easier to view data in order of date, ect. The second recommendation is to make the search as a dropdown format where the user does not need to know the exact spelling/abbreviation of the column value to perform a search.
